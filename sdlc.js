// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = 'The capabilities necessary for that goal are determined.'
const design = 'The operations necessary for those capabilities are outlined.'
const implementation = 'Those operations are translated into minimum viable software.'
const testingAndIntegration = 'That software is iterated and improved to meet standards, such as reliability and performance.'
const maintain = 'The software is further iterated and improved as needs change or issues are found.'
